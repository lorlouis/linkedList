# ll
A simple doubly linked list implementation

## How to use
Just run: `make rel`

You should find 2 directories named `include` and `lib`
Just copy them to your project

you can include the headers with `#include "./include/ll/a_header.h"`

you need to add `-L./lib/ -llinkedList` to gcc to link the lib.
